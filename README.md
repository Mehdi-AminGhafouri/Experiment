Loading images from folder with data augmentation  _ label them from name of folder
====================================
Loading data seems like an easy task, but sometimes loading data from within folders and labeling them takes a long time.
With this code you can skip this section and focus more on the preprocessing and model training sections.
Easier ways to load data are provided by different libraries, but if you want to take full control of them and all the changes are exactly what you want, it is better to write the code yourself or use this code. 


For ease of work, we have divided the codes into the following files
- Code loading images from folders and labeling (Python)
- Code loading images from folders + generating more images and labeling (Python)
- Code loading images from folders and labeling (MATLAB) 
- load images from colab(google Drive)


Usage:
------
use these code for loading your images from folders and label them with data augmentation 


Help
------------
you first folder of dataset for example train data should be like that:  .../train/{ClassName}/image.png
you can load any tipe of image we use * for type of image wich mean any type : .png .jpg .jpeg
